[Qtec Problem 1]

Step 1: Create an ORM Data Model in Laravel for User Search History in an imagined Search Engine. Could be a very simple and small search engine with search results. You can store anything[fields] you want. Like, search keyword, which used searched, what time.. What results came after searching.. etc.. Add as many fields as you like. 

Step 2: Dump those results in a view[html/css or any frontend framework you prefer] and add some filters like, 
Keywords with count, user , time range with checkbox. Imagine it like this

All Keywords:
[ ] Keyword 1 (20 times found)
[ ]  Keyword 2 (12 times found)
[ ]  Keyword 3 (8 times found)

All Users:
[ ] User 1
[ ] User 2
[ ] User 3

Time Range:
[ ] See data from yesterday
[ ] See data from last week
[ ] see data from last month 

Select Date:
[ Enter start date]
[ Enter end date ]

More filters:
[ ]
[ ]

Note: [ ] those are checkboxes

Step 3: If I select any of those checkboxes, results will be filtered using some JS or any frontend framework you prefer, without reloading the page. If I select multiple checkboxes, results will be filtered based on that.

[Qtec Problem 2]


Write a program which will find all occurrences of a pattern in a text .Suppose there is a text “tadadattaetadadadafa” and a  pattern “dada”, now you have to find how many times “data” appear in “tadadattaetadadadafa” . Here the pattern (data) appears in text (tadadattaetadadadafa) 3 times .


NB :  Instead of using a builtin function,  write your code from scratch . And also write a little documentation about  how your algorithm works
